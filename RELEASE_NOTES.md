# HeliboardL v3.6.1 Release

This major update introduces a **dual-release strategy** to give you complete control over privacy and functionality.

## 📦 Choose Your Version

### 1. Standard Version (`-standard-release.apk`)
*   **Features:** Full suite including **AI Proofreading**, **AI Translation**, and **Gesture Library Downloader**.
*   **Permissions:** Requires `INTERNET` permission (used *only* when you explicitly use AI features or download libraries).
*   **Best For:** Users who want smart features alongside privacy.

### 2. Offline Version (`-offline-release.apk`) 🛡️
*   **Features:** All UI/UX refinements (Squircle keys, new Icons) but **excludes** all AI and network features.
*   **Permissions:** **NO INTERNET PERMISSION** in the manifest. Guaranteed at the OS level.
*   **Best For:** Privacy purists who require a hard guarantee that no data can ever leave the device.

## ✨ What's New
*   **🕵️ New Incognito Icon**: Distinct "Hat & Glasses" outline for clear visibility in all themes (Light/Dark).
*   **🎨 Modern UI**: "Squircle" key backgrounds and refined spacing key UI.
*   **🤖 AI Enhancements**: 
    *   **Proofreading**: Fix grammar/spelling instantly (Standard).
    *   **Translation**: Translate selected text in-place (Standard).
*   **📥 Gesture Library**: Built-in downloader for Glide Typing support (Standard).

> **Note:** Both versions install as `helium314.keyboard.l`. You can install them alongside the original HeliBoard, but you can only have one HeliboardL version installed at a time.
